# NamoNexus Frontend Prototype — Feature and Validation Summary

## Cover
NamoNexus Frontend Prototype
Feature, Validation, and Production Approval Gates

## Slide 2
### A frontend prototype with a controlled boundary
- Multi-page frontend prototype from the real source repository
- Preview-only: no backend, API, email, analytics, database, storage, deployment, DNS, or production change
- Audience: team, product, engineering, and executive reviewers

## Slide 3
### The experience now has one navigational system
- Home: business positioning, fit, capabilities, principles, CTA
- Capability: Discover → Design → Prototype → Validate
- Principles: sovereignty, risk inputs, decision rights, evidence ladder
- Contact: data-minimizing qualification with local-only success state

## Slide 4
### The Hero leads with the decision that matters
- “AI systems for decisions that matter.”
- Private, human-centered AI systems for sensitive environments
- CTA routes: View capabilities and Start a conversation
- CSS/SVG motion panel remains decorative and optional

## Slide 5
### Capability is expressed as decision discipline
- Discover: reduce problem uncertainty
- Design: reduce control uncertainty
- Prototype: reduce implementation uncertainty
- Validate: reduce investment uncertainty
- Each stage includes an engineering focus, decision gate, and illustrative artifact

## Slide 6
### Principles make enterprise risk visible
- Sovereignty is broader than data residency
- Risk inputs cover data, model, workflow, operations, governance, and adoption
- Decision rights identify who approves, reviews, overrides, pauses, rolls back, and owns the decision
- Evidence ladder distinguishes principle, method, artifact, validation, and approved evidence

## Slide 7
### Contact qualification minimizes exposure
- Fields are limited to name, work email, organization context, conversation focus, high-level situation, Broad timing, preview consent, and a hidden honeypot
- Users are explicitly told not to submit health, financial, credential, security, incident, regulated, or confidential information
- Prototype has no network request and no storage
- Local success message states that no data was sent, stored, emailed, or recorded

## Slide 8
### The SVG motion panel has a production path
- Stable logo core with restrained orbital rings and particles
- Deep Navy base, Electric Cyan primary accent, restrained Magenta secondary accent
- CSS/SVG only; no watermarked video, remote media, sound, or analytics
- Reduced-motion mode removes animation and keeps a static treatment

## Slide 9
### Validation covered the important frontend risks
The validation matrix records only the latest run. Each check is marked PASS, FAIL, or UNVERIFIED in the main report; no obsolete route report is retained.

## Slide 10
### Contact behavior is intentionally unconnected
- Empty submit validates the required fields: name, work email, organization, organization context, conversation focus, high-level situation, and preview consent
- Invalid work email, situation text over 1,200 characters, the canonical sensitive-term categories, missing consent, and honeypot population are guarded
- Valid high-level input transitions to local success state
- No API, email, CRM, database, storage, or analytics request was made

## Slide 11
### The prototype is evidence-disciplined
- No customer metrics, client names, certifications, security guarantees, or unsupported outcomes were added
- Illustrative artifacts are labelled as illustrative
- Full production build is UNVERIFIED because the scope is frontend-only
- Existing chunk-size warning is non-blocking and did not fail the frontend build

## Slide 12
### Executive handoff and approval gates
- Approve master SVG geometry, rights, clear space, minimum sizes, monochrome variants, and motion behavior
- Approve privacy notice, retention/deletion, consent, data residency, access control, spam controls, sender/recipient ownership, and rollback
- Approve backend validation, logging redaction, rate limits, outage behavior, and operational lead ownership
- Decide what evidence may be published and what remains illustrative

The closing recommendation is to approve the boundary, brand asset, Contact data model, evidence standard, and operating owner first. Only then should a separate backend integration and production release plan be considered.

## Presenter tone
Measured, technical, and non-promotional. Distinguish validated behavior from illustrative content and unresolved production decisions. Do not imply production readiness, confidentiality, compliance, customer outcomes, or security guarantees.
